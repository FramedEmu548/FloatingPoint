# FloatingPoint
FloatingPoint is a game that focusses on accesibility and playability. FloatingPoint will be playable on the desktop using electron, or on the internet. FloatingPoint intends to have a very accesable and inclusive forum in which the players frequently seggust edits and changes, report bugs, and ask for things to be removed. FloatingPoint also aims to remove nucences like (but not limited to) Jump fatuige, excesssive Bloom, and extreme aim assist. FloatingPoint is developed entirely by one developer as a way to learn coding to a fuller extent. This means that while the game might lack some extra things like fancy animations and extensive file systems, it still has the spririt and fun of a typical game. All in all, FLoatingPoint is going to become a great game with lots of community, less glitches and bugs, and more playing time/accesibility. FloatingPoint hopes to release in an early beta in mid september, but this deadline is not hard and fast, and it could possibly be moved, according to the state of the development.
